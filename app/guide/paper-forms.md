If you receive a request to send a parent a paper-based consent form, you:

1. Go to **Sessions**, then the **Scheduled** tab.
2. Find the relevant school.
3. On the school page, click on the **Download consent form** link.
4. You can then print the form off and send it to the parent who requested it.

Once the parent returns the form, you can enter the information given using the Get consent flow.

1. From the **Check consent responses** page, go into the **No response** tab.
2. Go to into a child record by clicking on their name.
3. Scroll down and select **Get consent response**.
4. Use the radio button to indicate who’s responded.
5. Go through the consent flow, making sure to select **Paper** as the way the response was given.
