We're coming to ==location name== on ==next session dates== to give the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. We would like your consent to vaccinate ==patient name==. You can give this by filling in our online form (the link is below).

### What the vaccine is for

The HPV vaccine helps protect boys and girls against cancers caused by HPV, including:

- cervical cancer
- some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
- some cancers of the anal and genital areas

It also helps protect against genital warts.

The HPV vaccine works best if it’s given before young people become sexually active.
