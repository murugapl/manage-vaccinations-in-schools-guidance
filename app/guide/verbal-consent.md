If you phone a parent to get verbal consent before a session starts, you can record this in Mavis.

1. From the **Consent** tab of a session page, filter for children with **No response**.
2. Go into a child record by clicking on their name.
3. Scroll down and select **Get consent response**.
4. Use the radio button to indicate who you’re trying to get consent from (you can add a new contact if necessary).
5. Call the parent.
6. Record their response.
7. Check and confirm their answers, and select **Confirm**.
