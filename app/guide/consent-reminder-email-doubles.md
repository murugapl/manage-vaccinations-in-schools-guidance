### About the MenACWY vaccine

The MenACWY vaccine helps protect against life-threatening illnesses including meningitis, sepsis and septicaemia (blood poisoning).

It is recommended for all teenagers. Most people only need 1 dose of the vaccine.

### About the Td/IPV vaccine

The Td/IPV vaccine helps protect against tetanus, diphtheria and polio.

It’s offered at around 13 or 14 years old (school year 9 or 10). It boosts the protection provided by the [6-in-1 vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/6-in-1-vaccine/) and [4-in-1 pre-school booster](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/4-in-1-preschool-booster-vaccine/) vaccine.

We suggest you talk to your child about the vaccinations before you respond to us.

Young people have the right to refuse vaccinations. Those who show [‘Gillick competence'](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/) have the right to consent to vaccinations themselves. Our team may assess Gillick competence during vaccination sessions.
