You can only record vaccinations for children who are registered as attending a session.

To register children as attending or absent:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Today** tab.
3. Click on the name of the school you’re attending.
4. Click on **Register attendance**.

If you want to, you can filter the list of children by **Ready for nurse** and mark those children as attending or absent.

When you mark a child as attending or absent, a banner at the top of the page will tell you whether the child is ready for the nurse or not.
