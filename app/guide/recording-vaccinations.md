## Select the child and programme

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Go to the **Today** tab.
3. Click on the name of the school you’re attending.
4. Click on **Record vaccinations** under the relevant programme.
5. A list of children’s names is displayed - you can filter the list by name or year group.

## Review the child’s details and do pre-screening checks

Once you’ve reviewed the information on the page, you’ll need to confirm the child’s identity and carry out pre-screening checks.

1. Select the relevant radio button to state whether the child or someone else confirmed their identity.
2. If it was someone else, enter their name and relationship to the child.
3. Run through the pre-screening checks and confirm you’ve checked the statements are correct. You can add notes if you want to. 
4. Indicate whether you think the child is ready to vaccinate using the radio buttons at the bottom of the page.
